# Custom-Surviv-Sounds
This is my own set of random sounds I put in the game. These sounds are mostly just memes, so have fun with it! (Warning your ears may be blasted off by some of them). This idea is from Humphrey Gaming ( https://github.com/humphreygaming/survivcustomsounds )

# Instructions for Installing
1. Download the zip file.
2. Unzip the file (this should give you a folder named "Slum_Surviv_Sounds"
3. Go to chrome://extensions in your browser. (Or just go to settings and go to manage extensions)
4. In the top right make sure you have Developer Mode ON.
5. Now in the top left go to the "Load Unpacked" button and click it.
6. Select the "Slum_Surviv_sounds" file.
7. Turn on the extension.
8. Go to surviv.io and enjoy the custom sound (pretty much a meme).
